# Course on Computer Vision

Welcome to the "Course on Computer Vision"! This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of computer vision, covering key concepts, techniques, and applications.

## Overview



## What You Will Learn
* Understand the basic concepts of machine learning.
* Create and train a neural network in Python with pytorch.
* Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world data.
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Filter an image for a particular feature (convolution)
* Detect that feature within the filtered image (ReLU)
* Condense the image to enhance the features (maximum pooling)
* Data Augmentation
* Test Time Augmentation
* Ensemble Learning
* Transfer Learning
* Collaborate with a team to solve machine learning problems.


## Prerequisites
* Ensure that git is installed on your machine. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks.
